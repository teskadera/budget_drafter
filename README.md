# BudgetDrafter


This is the core gem for the BudgetDrafter project.
Short-term, high-level financial planning tool for individuals/families. Intended to allow comparison between potential budgets over a 1-5 year period. It is not intended as a day-to-day purchase tracker, but as a tool to consult monthly or to help build a guide.
It will take in a user's bills, debts, goals, and income. From this, it will generate data for passing off to a front-end for graphing usage.
